Follow [this guide](https://github.com/GomuSkelly/MozAIk/edit/main/README.md), then install [cg-use-everywhere](https://github.com/chrisgoringe/cg-use-everywhere) nodes via the Manager in ComfyUI.

On a 4060TI 16GB, the newly added generative sampler takes just under 10 mins to create a full 64 clip sample bank at 47.6s per sample length.

YMMV with samples shorter/longer than 47.6s.

(Some prompts work really well with a few seconds sample length and others sound garbled)
