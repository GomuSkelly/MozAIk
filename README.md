## MozAIk

### Generative A\VJ System

MozAIk v1 wf is a barebones implementation in ComfyUI for audio/artwork generation. Combined with the Mixxx DJing software, it constitutes the realtime generative DJing aspect of MozAIk's A\VJ system.

### 2025-01-01 MozAIk v1 released.

For the initial release, a limited amount of custom nodes were used to ensure the core of MozAIk's audio system can be set up without many complications for beginners. 

In the days ahead, there will be more complex workflows released. 

Today we release a basic template, and plant the seed of MozAIk.

Have fun!
